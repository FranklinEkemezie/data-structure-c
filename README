# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It's part of my ongoing practice to deepen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.


## 🛠️ Implemented Data Structures
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and basic operations like insert, delete, and traversal.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.

## ⚙️ Algorithms
- **Sorting**: Implementations of bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- **Searching**: Linear search, binary search, and variations.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples like Fibonacci, knapsack problem, and more.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EkemezieFranklin/dsa-in-c.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dsa-in-c
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```


## 📚 Learning Goals
