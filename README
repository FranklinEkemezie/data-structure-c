# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It's part of my ongoing practice to deepen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Common Operations in Data Structures
- **Insertion**: Adding an element to a data structure.
- **Search**: Finding an element within a data structure.
- **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order.
- **Deletion**: Removing an element from a data structure.
- **Traversal**: Accessing each element in a data structure in a systematic manner.
- **isEmpty**: Checking if the data structure contains any elements.
- **Access**: Retrieving an element from a specific position.
- **Indexing**: Assigning an index to each element for quick access.
- **Initialization**: Setting up the data structure before use.


## 🛠️ Implemented Data Structures
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and basic operations like insert, delete, and traversal.
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.

## ⚙️ Algorithms
- **Sorting**: Implementations of bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- **Searching**: Linear search, binary search, and variations.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples like Fibonacci, knapsack problem, and more.
