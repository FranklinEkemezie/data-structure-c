/**
 * -------------------------------------
 * STACK data structure
 * Stack is a linear data structure that follows the
 * LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.
 * That is, only insertion and deletion operation is allowed
 * from one end of the stack, i.e. the top
 * Implementation of a stack can be:
 * - Static - using the usual array type with fixed size
 * - Dynamic - implemented using either a dynamic array implemented before or a linked list
 * It can also be implemented using memory which is:
 * - Contiguous - using an array
 * - Non-contiguous - using a linked list.
 * 
 * In this example, we are implementing:
 * - static and non-contiguous data type - using linked list
 * - dynamic and contiguous data type - using dynamic array
